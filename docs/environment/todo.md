Love the addition of the Portfolio and Editorial "tabs" and how it scrolls to the Copywriting section if needed. 

- [x] I do want to change the URL for the Copywriting section to be eviecarrick.com/porfolio instead of /commercial-work
- [] When I view the site on mobile, it shows logo files between "Editorial" and "Copywriting." Maybe it just needs to be cleaned up?

Here are the final things:
WORK
- [] There is a huge gap between "Writer | Copywriter | Editor" and "Editorial," can we minimize that so it doesn't look so awkward? Cut down the size of the cloud pic?
- [] Miscommunication on my part, but I don't want a long, thin horizontal line under "Editorial" or "Copywriting." You can delete those!
- [] Another miscom. But you can style Shaping Compelling Stories and Content That Resonates, like that (first letter uppercase on all words).

ABOUT 
- [] When you click the Instagram link with "Say hi on Instagram" it doesn't take you to a new webpage like the others. Can you fix?
